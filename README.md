# pneumonia-detection-pneumothorax-segmentation
In this project we have discovered the difference between classification and segmentation.
In the first part of my project we used transfer learning with Keras to implement models (VGG16, VGG19, InceptionV3) for
pneumonia detection. In the second part we did segmentation of pneumothorax using UNet with Fastai.
